# Data  Moms

## Project Summary:
At the end of the Data Science program, students are required to complete a final project of their choice. They are given six weeks to work on the project. Often times, they will be paired up with another fellow-student.
This document is dedicated to Jillian and Kesley. It will explain the purpose and scope for the project.
To showcase the skills that Jillian and Kesley have acquired through the Data Science program. They will be using R, Python, Tableau and other programs to wrangle, analyze, and visualize the “Food Allergy Analysis” dataset made available by Zenodo.
At the end of the project, Jillian and Kesley should be able to explain their work in layman’s term, and present their findings to the faculty via Zoom.
As a way to activate and put practical use to what the students have learned, doing a final project is a good way to demonstrate that.
Jillian and Kesley have chosen the “Food Allergy Analysis” dataset because they are both interested in children’s health and preventative care. They hope to glean insight from this document to make actionable suggestions on how to identify who is most at risk for food allergies.
